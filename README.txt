Make sure that you ahve node.js installed to use npm commands in a cmd shell. Make sure you installed nodemon and peerJS too, with the command "npm i nodemon peer".

Then, you need to type "npm run start" and "peerjs --port 8002" in two different cmd shelves (at the root of the folder), to make it run in your localhost:8001.
